# 🧾 Payments & Orders System — Product Requirements

## 🎯 Goal

Enable users to place orders and pay securely through a third-party payment provider, ensuring reliability, consistency, and a smooth user experience.

---

# 1. ✅ Functional Requirements

## 🛒 Orders

- Users can create an order with:
  - Items
  - Total amount
  - Currency
- Each order has a lifecycle:
  - `CREATED`
  - `PENDING_PAYMENT`
  - `PAID`
  - `FAILED`
  - `CANCELLED`

---

## 💳 Payments

- Users can initiate a payment for an order
- System creates a payment intent with the gateway
- System tracks payment status:
  - `INITIATED`
  - `SUCCEEDED`
  - `FAILED`
  - `REFUNDED`

---

## 🔔 Webhooks

- System receives asynchronous events from the payment provider:
  - Payment success
  - Payment failure
  - Refund updates
- Systemcc updates internal state aordingly

---

## 🔁 Idempotency

- Duplicate payment requests must not create duplicate charges
- Same request must return the same result

---

## 💸 Refunds

- Support:
  - Full refunds
  - Partial refunds
- Refund status must be tracked

---

## 📊 Payment History

- Users can view:
  - Past orders
  - Payment status
  - Refund history

---

## 🔐 Authentication

- Only authenticated users can:
  - Create orders
  - Initiate payments
  - View their own data

---

# 2. ⚙️ Non-Functional Requirements

## 📈 Scalability

- Handle:
  - High read volume (order lookups)
  - Moderate write volume (payments)
- Support horizontal scaling

---

## ⚡ Latency

- Payment initiation: < 300ms (excluding gateway delay)
- Order retrieval: < 100ms

---

## 🔒 Consistency

- Strong consistency for:
  - Order ↔ payment state
- Eventual consistency acceptable for:
  - Analytics
  - Reporting

---

## 🔁 Reliability

- Handle:
  - Duplicate webhook deliveries
  - Temporary gateway failures
- Prevent double charges

---

## 🧯 Fault Tolerance

- Recover from:
  - Service crashes
  - Network failures
- Include retry mechanisms

---

## 📡 Availability

- Target: 99.9% uptime
- Payment flow should degrade gracefully if gateway is slow/unavailable

---

## 🧾 Auditability

- All payment events must be logged
- Support traceability for:
  - Disputes
  - Debugging

---

# 3. 🔥 Edge Cases

- User closes page before payment completes
- Payment succeeds but webhook is delayed
- Webhook delivered multiple times
- Payment succeeds but DB update fails
- Currency mismatch
- Expired payment intent
- Partial refunds across multiple items

---

# 4. 📊 Metrics

- Payment success rate
- Payment latency
- Failure rate by reason
- Refund rate
- Webhook processing delay

---

# 5. 🚫 Out of Scope

- Fraud detection
- Multi-gateway routing
- Subscription billing
- Chargebacks / disputes
